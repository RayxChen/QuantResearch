## Hypothesis

The company's financial statements have a causal impact on quarterly returns, with adjustments made to account for the confounding influences of the specified quarter, sector, and additional treatment-specific confounders.

### Brief

causal_study.ipynb found the causal impact (though data was not enough the prediction have captured important metrics that gave the right decisions say top3 long of AAPL/MSFT/WMT, short of IBM/BA/TRV). And portfolio_study_result.ipynb incorporated such impact into the optimisation. (cov matrix estimation needs to be improved with factor model)
