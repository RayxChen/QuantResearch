The sun rises and sets.
Lives begin and end.
Markets boom and bust.

The tool to understand the cycles:

# Fourier transform
One can't know the time and frequency domains simultaneously. -Heisenberg uncertainty principle

# Wavelets
One can know both the time and frequency domains simultaneously, but constrained to the resolution.

# Scattering transform
One can know both the time and frequency domains simultaneously. Although constrained to the resolutions, they're hierarchically ensembled.
